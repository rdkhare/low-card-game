## Low-Card Game

This is a game that my friends and I played at school (inspired by former random-cards.com).
Modified it slightly to go with the rules that we created.

### Rules:

1. Gather a group of 2+ friends and open this website at [low-card-game](https://low-card-game.vercel.app/)
2. Can either play on "Casual" or "Degen" (degen is preferred)
3. If you want, put something on the line for the loser (e.g. loser has to buy drinks for the group)
4. Each person can flip their card over and select if they "lost" or "won"
5. Losing is if you have the lowest number out of your group, otherwise you won
6. If you lose a +2 handicap is added to your next flipped card until you "win"
